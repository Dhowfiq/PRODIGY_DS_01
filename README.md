# PRODIGY_DS_01
This project aims to analyze and visualize the distribution of salaries in the field of data science using a dataset sourced from Kaggle.

KEY OBJECTIVES:

Explore and clean the dataset to prepare it for analysis.
Visualize the distribution of salaries using histograms and statistical summaries.
Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify insights into salary trends based on factors such as experience, location, and education.
Implement machine learning models (if applicable) to predict salary ranges or factors influencing salary.
Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the analysis for stakeholders in the data science community.

TOOLS USED :

Python for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization (libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn).
Google collab for interactive data exploration and analysis.
GitHub for version control and collaboration.

Data Source:
The dataset "ds_salaries.csv" contains anonymized data related to salaries in the data science field, sourced from undisclosed sources.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS:

Expand the analysis to include more datasets or additional variables to enhance understanding of salary dynamics.
Incorporate sentiment analysis of job postings or related discussions to correlate with salary trends.
Collaborate with other data scientists to compare findings and methodologies.
